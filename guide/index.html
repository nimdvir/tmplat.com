<p>
  Template uses an advanced, yet simple, template system to allows you to create and modify the content to be copied to
  the clipboard. The syntax is really straight-forward and consists of the following categories;
</p>

<h2 id="simple-tag">Simple Tag</h2>
<p>
  Tags are always surrounded by curly braces like this <code>{name}</code> and output the value of the named variable.
  If that value is undefined or <em>falsey</em> it will simply be deleted.
</p>
<p>
  Values are not escaped by default and, in order to do so, you must either use double braces like
  <code>{{ '{{name' }}}}</code> or a leading ampersand like <code>{&amp;name}</code>. This will escape
  <code>&amp;</code> <code>&lt;</code> <code>&gt;</code> <code>&quot;</code> <code>&#39;</code> characters so that the
  final output can be safely copied in to XML and HTML.
</p>

<h2 id="section">Section</h2>
<p>
  Sections are always surrounded by opening and closing tags like this <code>{#name}...{/name}</code> and can be used
  for the following purposes;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Conditions</strong> - Only renders the contents if the value is <em>truey</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Iterating</strong> - If the value is an array it will render the contents for each enumerable item of that
    value
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Access</strong> - If the value is an object it will render the contents while exposing the properties of
    that object as variables
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Operations</strong> - Renders the outcome of the operation, passing the contents as the argument
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="inverted-section">Inverted Section</h2>
<p>
  Inverted sections are very similar to normal sections but are written like this <code>{^name}...{/name}</code> and can
  be used in for the following purposes;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Conditions</strong> - Only renders the contents if the value is <em>falsey</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Iterating</strong> - Only renders the contents if the value is an empty list
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Access</strong> - Only renders the contents if the value is an empty object
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dot-notation">Dot Notation</h2>
<p>
  Nested properties of objects can also be accessed using dot notation like <code>{name.nested}</code> which would get
  the <em>nested</em> property of the <em>name</em> object. These expressions can be even chained to access properties
  of nested properties and so on.
</p>

<h2 id="case-sensitivity">Case Sensitivity</h2>
<p>
  The names of simple tags and sections are case-insensitive, therefore <code>{name}</code> will output the same as
  <code>{NaMe}</code>. However, sections must be opened and closed with names in the same case (i.e.
  <code>{#name}...{/NaMe}</code> will not work).
