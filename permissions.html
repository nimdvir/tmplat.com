    <p>
      Some browsers need you to grant extensions and apps special permissions when installed to help you keep control.
      The permissions mentioned on this page are all required by tmplat in order to provide complete functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of these permissions can appear to be quite scary so we have attempted to explain why each one is required.
      If, for whatever reason, you doubt these explanations or are simply curious, please feel free to take a look at
      the <a href="https://github.com/tmplat-extension">source code</a> yourself. It is open source after all.
    </p>

    <h2 id="visible">Visible</h2>
    <p>
      These permissions should be displayed in a <em>warning</em> message when you first install tmplat and you will
      be asked to accept them:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="label label-warning">chrome</span>
        <strong>&quot;Data you copy and paste&quot;</strong> &raquo; Although this is a no-brainer for most of you, some
        long-term users may wonder why this wasn't always displayed. Well, that's because this permission didn't even
        exist until <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/whats_new.html#13">Chrome 13</a>, where it was
        introduced.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="label label-warning">chrome</span>
        <strong>&quot;Your browsing history&quot;</strong> &raquo; This is required in order to execute the keyboard
        shortcut and <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> parser script on all previously opened pages which
        is required when installing/updating/re-enabling the extension to ensure consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="label label-warning">chrome</span>
        <strong>&quot;Your physical location&quot;</strong> &raquo; This is required for the <a href="/guide/lists-objects/#coords">coords</a>
        object variable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="label label-warning">chrome</span>
        <strong>&quot;Your data on all websites&quot;</strong> &raquo; This is caused by the need to read the URL and
        page title as well as injecting the keyboard shortcut and <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> parser
        script in to all possible pages.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Further information on these permissions can be found in their corresponding developer websites:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/permission_warnings.html#warnings">Google Chrome</a>
        (<a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome_webstore/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=186213">more</a>)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="hidden">Hidden</h2>
    <p>You won't be warned about these permissions but tmplat does request them from the browser:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="label label-warning">chrome</span>
        <strong>&quot;contextMenus&quot;</strong> &raquo; This is required to support the right-click menus.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="label label-warning">chrome</span>
        <strong>&quot;cookies&quot;</strong> &raquo; This is required to make cookie information accessible to
        templates.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="label label-warning">chrome</span>
        <strong>&quot;notifications&quot;</strong> &raquo; This is required to display notifications to the user (if the
        associated option is enabled).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once again, further information on these <em>hidden</em> permissions can be found in their corresponding developer
      websites:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/permission_warnings.html#nowarning">Google Chrome</a>
